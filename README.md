# SMPRO3
Welcome our(group 6) code for the second semester project. 

Here are some Tips on using git:
# How can I set this up?
Download your favorite git client. I recommend the Github Desktop Client. Git Bash(https://git-scm.com/downloads) is a good command line tool, but if that looks too weird to you use Git Gui(https://git-scm.com/downloads) instead. It is a nice tool too.
Clone this repository. Just paste Link into Source Location
# How do I change the Code?
1. Make your changes in Atmel Studio to your local repository
2. If you use the command line. or
```
#git add File-name
(You only have to do this once)
```
3. Write a usefull Comment and. Commit your changes. or
```
#git commit
```
4. Upload your changes by pressing Push origin. or
```
#git push 
```
# How do I dowload the Code?
Click Fetch Origin at the top. or

#git pull
```
